2. IO

3. CPU

4. TickCountCompleted is incremented on each clock tick for the running thread.
TickCountEarly is incremented if the thread yields the CPU before the clock ticks, i.e. by yielding or by blocking.

IO bound has a higher value of TickCountEarly since they are blocked a lot by components outside of the cpu.

5. Done. It doesn't say to do anything, so just take my word that I did it.
